# Introduction
* Why Linux
* Why Manjaro
* Why this video

# My system

## Dell Latitude E6500
* Manufactured 2009
* Came with Windows Vista (still on small partition)
* Used since July 2015 -- longest Linux system I've ever used continuously

# Explanation of Manjaro system
* Comparison with Ubuntu (less mainstream)
* Arch base
* Rolling release -- current FOSS updates
* Great distribution for intermediate users

# Explanation of Linux

## Desktop environments separate from kernel

## Many distributions

## Exaggerated benefits
* Can't assume that Linux will automatically make old PCs work for everything
* Won't automatically make you an elite developer or hacker
* Won't *necessarily* increase your technical competency

## Exaggerated difficulty
* Not inherently more difficult than any other OS -- ease of use depends on appropriateness to the situation
* Not obscure or unknown
* Though niche, being niche isn't remarkable

## Why you might want to set up a Linux system
* You have perfectly good computer equipment on hand
* You want more out-of-the-box support for a web development environment than you'll likely get with Windows
* You want to find a reasonable solution for continuing to use an ageing PC
* You like the variety and creativity of Linux

## Stuff I can do well
* Writing (Focuswriter/Libreoffice Writer)
* Office stuff
* Front-end web development (Atom doesn't work easily on Manjaro)

## Software I use
* Sublime Text
* LibreOffice
* FileZilla
* Inkscape
* GIMP
* Pencil
* Thunderbird
* Firefox / Chromium
* SimpleScreenRecorder
* NPM / Stylus / Less

## Problems I've had
* Sass (and possibly Ruby environment) broken
* Installing software, finding the right software
* Back-end web development (package system confusion/complication)
* CMS installation in XAMPP
* Gaming
* Recent memory leaks/crashes

# Closing remarks

## Linux as example of using tech at your level
* Respect for people who take the effort to use things deliberately
* Empathy for people who are stressed and discouraged with tech

## Community as key for making real things skillfully with technology
* Forums as a basic form of community, but you can research anything forever
* Sincerely trying to support others, and to work toward shared goals
